  /// which is a moveable pointer over a mutable buffer.  Mutability is a key difference; it means that moving the position of a
  /// stream backward allows you to overwrite the data from that position to the end of the stream, while moving the position of a 
  /// cursor backward only changes the index in the sequence from which data is replayed to new subscribers.  In other words, data 
  /// written to a stream is always inserted at the current position, but data observed by a cursor is always appended to the end 
  /// of the buffered sequence.
  /// </para>

  /// Furthermore, the position of a stream is shared between reads and writes, but the position of a cursor is not.  A cursor's 
  /// position is only used by reads (subscribers) and is entirely independent of writes.  Subscribing to a cursor replays the data 
  /// in the sequence from the current index to the end; however, the current index is not moved at all.  Changing the index later
