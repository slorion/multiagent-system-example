  /// <para>
  /// This type of result is used by lazy quantifiers.  It does not represent <em>look-ahead</em> as in the Regular
  /// Expression sense.  That kind of look-ahead can be expressed using a normal <c>SelectMany</c> query by simply applying 
  /// the <c>NonGreedy</c> operator to the first parser.  That will effectively allow the first parser to look-ahead for a 
  /// match from the current position of the cursor, without consuming the results.  The second parser is then executed from 
  /// the same starting position as the first parser, but only when the first parser matches.
  /// </para>
  /// <para>
  /// Instead, this type of result allows quantifiers to end lazily by asking <c>SelectMany</c> if the second parser matches 
  /// after each successful match from the quantified parser, starting at the end of the current match.  Essentially, it's like 
  /// adding <c>NonGreedy</c> to each individual match instead of adding it to the entire quantified parser.  Behaviorally, it's 
  /// a special kind of result that indicates to <c>SelectMany</c> to look ahead at the second parser and notify the result 
  /// whether it's successful or not, without yielding.
  /// </para>
  /// <alert type="implement">
  /// The <see cref="OnCompleted"/> implementation must only accept a single call, specifying <see langword="true"/> to
